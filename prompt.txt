Deep Prompt for Generating a "Crypto Bank" Hero Webpage with React JS
Create a visually stunning "Crypto Bank" hero section webpage in React JS inspired by the attached Astrobank design. The website should capture the following elements, styles, and UI concepts:

Features & Sections
Navigation Bar at the top:

Dark, glassmorphic background.

Logo on the left.

Menu items: Cards, Services, Business, Features, FAQ.

CTA buttons: "Sign in" and "Get Started" on the right.

Rounded corners and elegant hover states.

Hero Section:

Large, bold headline: "Pay, invest money & save you money with a single bank".

Highlighted/inset color for keywords like "single bank".

Subheadline: "Extract your money without commissions anywhere in the world".

Two prominent buttons: "Get started" (gradient background, glowing effect) and "Learn more" (transparent or subtle outline).

Background gradient with deep blue, purple, and magenta hues, subtle geometric patterns or circular digital effects.

Visuals:

Floating crypto debit card mockup with bank logo and details, angled as in the sample.

Hand holding a crypto coin (Ethereum or similar), illuminated with neon/purple glow.

Subtle blur/glassmorphism effect behind card and coin.

3D or subtle animated icons.

Statistics Section:

Four stat cards in a horizontal row:

0% Commissions

12% Cashback

54% Customers

9.3b Investments

Each stat in a colored card with soft drop shadow, rounded corners, minimal icons.

Interactive "Learn more" links under each stat.

Design & Visual Style
Color Palette:

Gradients: midnight blue → purple → magenta.

Accent neon/sky blue, pink highlights.

Glassmorphism panels with frosted glass effect.

Card and button glow on hover.

Large font sizes for hero, stats, and CTA elements.

Assets:

React JS (functional components, hooks)

Styled Components or Tailwind CSS for gradients, glassmorphism, and responsive layout

Framer Motion or React Spring for smooth animation of hero visuals (card/coin)

SVGs for custom icons/cards

User Experience
Highlight feeling of trust, innovation, and unlimited access.

Microinteractions: hover/click on buttons, card tilt effect, pulsing glow.

Fast performance, smooth transitions.

Goal: Produce a React JS hero section and stat feature row, closely matching the attached design, emphasizing crypto bank innovation, trust, and visual impact with glassmorphism, glowing gradients, and interactive UI elements.
